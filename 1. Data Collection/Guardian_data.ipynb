    "## Web Scraping Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A web scraping process aimed at collecting news articles from an online platform is performed. 3 libraries were used to carry out our web scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `requests`: Retrieving web page content.(Python Software Foundation, n.d.)\n",
    "- `BeautifulSoup`: Parsing and navigating the HTML structure of these pages for data extraction.(Mitchell & Richardson, n.d.)\n",
    "- `pandas`: To structure the scraped information into a format ready for further analysis. (McKinney, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our extraction focuses on the articles titles and their main textual content, from a carefully chosen list of URLs. This required a process of identifying and extracting HTML elements known to house the title and body text, which were then compiled into a coherent dataset. This approach not only made the data collection process efficient for our needs but also helped the consistency and accuracy of the data prepared for analysis.\n"
