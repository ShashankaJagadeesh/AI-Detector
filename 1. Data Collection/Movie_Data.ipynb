    "## Web scraping approach using Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract reviews for the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\" from IMDb's website, we employed Selenium, a powerful browser automation tool commonly used for web scraping tasks involving dynamic content (Selenium Project 2022). The process begins by setting up the Selenium WebDriver, which initializes a Chrome browser instance to navigate IMDb's web pages and interact with dynamic elements (Selenium Project 2022). The `get_all_reviews()` function then utilized Selenium to dynamically load and extract reviews from the IMDb review section for the specified movie. This involved iteratively clicking the \"Load More\" button to fetch additional reviews until at least 100 reviews were retrieved, ensuring comprehensive data collection (Selenium Documentation 2022). Selenium's ability to handle dynamic content and simulate human browsing behavior was pivotal in navigating through IMDb's review pages and extracting the desired information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use Selenium was driven by its robust automation capabilities, particularly its effectiveness in handling dynamic web content and interacting with JavaScript-based elements, which are prevalent on modern websites like IMDb (Selenium Project 2022). Selenium's flexibility and extensive functionality made it well-suited for navigating through IMDb's review section and extracting reviews reliably."
