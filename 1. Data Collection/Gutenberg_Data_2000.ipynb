    "## Web Scraping Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A web scraping process aimed at collecting news articles from Al Jazeera's online platform is performed. 3 libraries were used to carry out our web scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `requests`: Retrieving web page content.(Python Software Foundation, n.d.)\n",
    "- `BeautifulSoup`: Parsing and navigating the HTML structure of these pages for data extraction.(Mitchell & Richardson, n.d.)\n",
    "- `pandas`: To structure the scraped information into a format ready for further analysis. (McKinney, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries (Python Software Foundation 2022; Crummy 2021), text material from Project Gutenberg ebooks is scraped from the web. Based on random ebook IDs, we develop a method to scrape text excerpts and ebook titles. For analysis, the data that was scraped is kept in a pandas DataFrame. Until the desired number of ebooks is attained, the procedure is repeated. After that, the DataFrame is stored for later use in a pickle file.\n"
